# 👤 User Management

## User Management Guide

User management controls who can access your Otutu system and what they can do. Proper user management ensures security, accountability, and efficient workflow by giving each person the right level of access for their role.

### Why This Matters

Without proper user management, you risk:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive financial data
* Accidental changes to critical information
* Confusion about responsibilities

Good user management provides:

* **Security:** Role-based access control
* **Accountability:** Audit trails
* **Efficiency:** Users have the tools they need
* **Compliance:** Proper permission controls

### Prerequisites

* Administrator access permissions
* Understanding of employee roles and responsibilities
* Company policies on data access

***

## User Roles and Permissions

Otutu uses a **role-based permission system**. Each role defines what users can see and do, ensuring employees access necessary tools while protecting sensitive information.

### Available Roles
