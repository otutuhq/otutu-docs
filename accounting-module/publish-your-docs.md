# 📑 Financial Reports

## Financial Reports Overview

Financial reports transform your raw transaction data into meaningful insights about your business's financial health. Think of reports as the story your numbers tell - they show you whether you're profitable, where your money is going, and how your business is performing over time. These reports are essential for making strategic decisions, securing financing, and meeting regulatory requirements.

### Why This Matters

Without financial reports, you're essentially running your business blindfolded. You might be busy and making money, but you have no way to know if you're actually profitable, if you're about to run out of cash, or which parts of your business are performing well. Financial reports provide the visibility you need to:

* Make informed business decisions
* Secure loans and investments
* Plan for taxes
* Identify trends and opportunities
* Measure performance against goals

### Prerequisites

* Sufficient transaction data (usually 1+ months)
* Properly categorized transactions
* Accounting module access permissions
