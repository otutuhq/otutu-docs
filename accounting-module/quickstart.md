# 🧱 Chart of Accounts

## Chart of Accounts Overview

The Chart of Accounts is the foundation of your entire accounting system - think of it as the filing system for all your financial transactions. Every dollar that comes in or goes out of your business gets filed into a specific account. This organized structure ensures you can track exactly where your money is coming from and where it's going, making it possible to generate meaningful reports and make smart business decisions.

### Why This Matters

Without a properly organized chart of accounts, your financial records would be like a messy desk with papers scattered everywhere - you'd have the information but couldn't find it when you need it. A well-structured chart of accounts helps you:

* Track income and expenses by category
* Generate accurate financial reports
* Make informed business decisions
* Satisfy tax and regulatory requirements
* Identify profitable and unprofitable areas of your business

### Prerequisites

* Accounting module access permissions
* Basic understanding of your business categories
* Company setup completed
