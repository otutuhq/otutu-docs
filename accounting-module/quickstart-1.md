# 🔀 Transaction Management

## Transactions

### Overview

Transactions are the individual financial events that make up your business’s financial story. Every time money moves in or out of your business, it is recorded as a transaction.

The transaction management system ensures every financial movement is properly categorized, documented, and automatically creates the necessary accounting entries to keep your books balanced.

### Why This Matters

Proper transaction management is like keeping a detailed diary of your business’s financial life. Without it, you would not be able to:

* Track cash flow and prevent overdrafts
* Identify spending patterns and cost-saving opportunities
* Prepare accurate tax returns
* Detect errors or fraud
* Make informed financial decisions

### Prerequisites

Before managing transactions, ensure the following are set up:

* Chart of accounts configured
* Bank accounts configured
* Accounting module access permissions

### Accessing Transactions

#### Step 1: Open the Transaction List

1. Click **Accounting** in the left navigation
2. Select **Transactions** from the dropdown menu
3. View all transactions with available filtering options
