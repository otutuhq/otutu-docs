# 🧭 Login and Dashboard

## Dashboard Overview

Welcome to **Otutu**! Your dashboard is the command center for your business finances. Think of it as your **financial cockpit** — everything you need to understand how your business is performing in one place. No more digging through spreadsheets or switching between multiple apps to understand your financial health.

Running a business without a clear financial dashboard is like flying a plane without instruments. You might be moving, but you don’t know if you’re going in the right direction, how much financial runway you have, or whether you’re heading toward trouble. Otutu’s dashboard gives you the **critical financial indicators** you need to make smart, confident business decisions.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* A valid Otutu user account
* Access permissions to at least one company

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Navigate to the Login Page**\
