# 🗂️ Basic Navigation

## Navigation Overview

Otutu is organized like a **filing cabinet** – everything has its logical place. The navigation mirrors how real businesses operate: money coming in (**Sales**), money going out (**Purchases**), tracking everything (**Accounting**), and managing your bank accounts (**Banking**).

Good navigation **saves time and reduces errors**. When you know exactly where to find everything, you spend less time searching and more time running your business. This organization also helps ensure you don't miss important financial tasks.

### Step-by-Step Instructions
