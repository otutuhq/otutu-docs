# 🧮 Bill Processing

## Bills Overview

Bills are invoices you receive from vendors for products and services you've purchased. Think of bills as requests for payment from your suppliers - they detail what you bought, how much it costs, and when payment is due. Proper bill management ensures you pay your suppliers on time while maintaining accurate expense records.

### Why This Matters

Poor bill management leads to late payments, damaged supplier relationships, and inaccurate expense tracking. Good bill management means you never miss a payment deadline, can plan your cash flow effectively, and have complete records of all business expenses for tax and reporting purposes.
