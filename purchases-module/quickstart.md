# 🏷️ Vendor Management

## Vendors Overview

Vendors are the businesses and people you pay for supplies, services, and materials. Think of vendors as your business partners - they provide everything you need to run your business, from office supplies to professional services. Managing vendor information properly helps you track expenses, maintain good relationships, and optimize your purchasing.

### Why This Matters

Poor vendor management leads to missed payments, damaged supplier relationships, and chaotic expense tracking. Good vendor management means you know who you owe money to, when payments are due, and which suppliers provide the best value. This helps you negotiate better terms, avoid late fees, and maintain a healthy supply chain.
