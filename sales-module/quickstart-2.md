# 📄 Estimates and Quotes

## Estimates Overview

Estimates (or quotes) are like price previews for your clients before they commit to buying. They help clients understand what they'll pay and give you a chance to win new business. When a client approves an estimate, you can easily convert it to an actual invoice.

### Why This Matters

Without proper estimates, clients might be surprised by final prices or hesitate to do business with you. Professional estimates:

* Build trust
* Set clear expectations
* Create a smooth path from proposal to payment

They also help you avoid scope creep and ensure both parties agree on the work and costs upfront.

### Prerequisites

* Client setup completed
* Product/service setup completed

### Step-by-Step Instructions
