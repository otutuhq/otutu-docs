# 🧾 Invoice Creation

## Invoices Overview

Invoices are how you ask clients to pay you. A professional invoice with clear details gets you paid faster and reduces confusion. Think of invoices as friendly but firm requests for payment that include everything the client needs to process your payment.

### Why This Matters

Poorly created invoices can lead to:

* Payment delays
* Disputes
* Cash flow problems

Professional invoices with clear descriptions, proper tax calculations, and organized line items show clients you're serious about your business and make it easy for them to pay you.

### Prerequisites

* Client setup completed
* Products/services configured in **Offerings**
