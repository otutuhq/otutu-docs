# 🔁 Recurring Invoices

## Recurring Invoices Overview

Recurring invoices are your automated billing assistant. Instead of creating the same invoice every month for subscription services or regular contracts, you set up a template once and Otutu automatically generates invoices on your schedule. It's like having a billing department that never sleeps.

### Why This Matters

Manual recurring billing is tedious and error-prone. Missing a monthly invoice means delayed payments and unhappy clients. Automated recurring invoices ensure you get paid on time, every time, while reducing administrative work. They're essential for any business with subscription models, retainers, or regular service contracts.

### Prerequisites

* Regular billing requirements identified
